Abstract:
PacePal is a movement and pace tracker tailored for runners and walkers, aiming to provide a comprehensive solution for logging, analyzing, and understanding physical activity. The device utilizes an accelerometer to effortlessly record steps and integrates GPS technology to map and measure the distance covered during activities. The ultimate goal is to streamline this data into a user-friendly API, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience for individuals monitoring their fitness routines. In essence, PacePal focuses on simplicity and practicality to enhance the user's fitness journey.

Scenario:
PacePal is designed for the average fitness enthusiast who not only enjoys running but values having data and knowledge to improve their performance. Unlike conventional fitness trackers, PacePal not only tracks pace for runs and walks but also provides users with a log of past runs, enabling them to make more time-efficient schedules by informing them of their average traversal times. In a final demo, users can walk back and forth in a designated area, checking the number of steps recorded by the app. Additionally, users can view the log of previous routes, showcasing the functionality of PacePal using both the accelerometer and GPS sensors.
